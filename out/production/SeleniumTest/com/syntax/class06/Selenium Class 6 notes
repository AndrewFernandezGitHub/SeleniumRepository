Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message.Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are
working on. We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 Types of Alerts:
1.Web based alerts/html alerts-if it is inspectable it is HTML alerts, we can inspect and perform needed actions

2.JavaScript alerts/browser alerts-we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method(we cannot inspect any javascript alert)

3.Windows based alerts-we cannot handle with Selenium or cancel

Types of JS Alerts
1.Simple alert-click ok
2.Confirmation alert either cancel or click ok
3.prompt alert-enter the text and then click ok or cancel


To handle JS alerts we have only 4 methods:
1.accept() - click ok
2.cancel() - click cancel
3.getText() -
4.sendKeys() -

To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the url
ex.
"http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
      //username:password@

Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
1.by index
2.by name or id
3.by WebElement

in alerts-Switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames-switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

How do you handler alerts in selenium?
We handle Alerts by using Alert interface
