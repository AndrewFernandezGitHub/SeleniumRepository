Alerts
1)Web Based Alerts-->HTML-->can be dealt using selenium

2)javascript Alerts

3)Windows Based Alert


Frames:
u need to switch to the frame in order to deal with the desired element

for switching you use driver.switchto.frame();

3 methods
1)by the index number of the frame
2)by the name or id
3)by accessing the frame as a webElement

<html>
    <body>

    </body>

</html>

Explicit Wait WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver,20);
why the timeout is important?

wait.until(ExceptedCondition.visibilityOfElement)

use impicit wait when the element is not even in the dom/needs to appear
and use explicit wait if the element has certain condition associated with it like
visibility, clickability,etc
