<form t="1908 aa">
    <div text="mydiv">
        <label name="myid"/>
        <input t="ad 123 34"/>

advance xpath:
get to the nearest sibling,parent or ancestor first and then have access to the desired tag

following sibling:
//label[@name="myid"]/following-sibling::input
-hey get me tag with name "label whose attribute name has value "myid"
and then get me its following-sibling which is"input

preceding-sibling
the sibling that is above
//label[@name="myid"]/following

following sibling:
//label[@name]"myid"]/following-sibling::input
hey get me tag with name "label" whose attribute "name" has value "myid" and then get me
its following-sibling which is "input";

preceding-sibling:
the sibling that is above.
//input[@id= 'calFromDate']/preceding-sibling::label

parent:
//label[text()="Enter message"]/parent::div
hey get me the "label" with the text "Enter message" and then get me its parent "div"

ancestor
//label[text()="Enter message"]/ancestor::form
hey get me tag with the name "label" with the text "Enter Message" and then get me its's ancestor
"form"


Locators:
driver.findElement(By.xpath/css/name/id/tag/etc(""));



Whenever we have dropdowns that are made using select class,
we can use select class in selenium to deal with them

The process:
1.Get to the select tag for that dropdown using your driver.findElement
2.create an instance of Select class and pass your webElement
3.we can select any option by value/by visible text/by index

no such element selection go check css selection or selector

byvalue;
byindex;
byvalueindex;
