/ interview question of the day --> stale element reference exception.
*anything causes reload/refresh the whole page (ex: click to nextpage);
*webdriver is not able to retrieve the elements of the page we already located because page is reloaded/refreshed (not table itselfs, whole page)
*the elements we located are changed. selenium forgets about them. because the referenced web element is no longer attached to the DOM.
*if we want to avoid from that exception on refresh/reload situation, we need to get/locate every element after each refresh/reload again.
*we can use loop so that we can get webelements every time we are going through the loop.
