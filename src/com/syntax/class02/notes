Selenium Class 2

What is a WebElement?
anything we see on the webpage is considered to be a web element
ex. buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, search boxes,links, etc

HTML?-->Hyper Text Market Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browsers internal view of webpage
Also called as Developers tools or Dev tools

Document-->Can be stored any document such as pdf, excel..
Object--> any line in HTML is considered Object
Model-->it is just they layout of the HTML

Locator(there are 8 total)
is aan address or a position of an webelement on the webpage
is used to locate or identify webelements on the web page

8 Locators
-ID
-Name
_TagName
-Xpath
-CSS selector
-Class name
-Linktext
-Partial Linktext

HTML Scripting Meaning:
Purple--> tags||button,input,div
Brown--> attributes|| name, class, id,
Blue-->attribute value

//when locating elements, be specific to have the id for that element, they are unique

WHy do we need many locators?

--Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
--some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
--some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are loooking for
ex. linktext and partialLinkttext

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

if two or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, selenium will only interact with the
first element it locates
